<img src="https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/32r7s2skrgm9ubva/branch/master" />


A simple desktop application for tracking your Overwatch competitive rank over time. I may generalise this in the future, to support other games.

Features:
+ Quick form for recording matches
+ Automatically determines outcomes (wins, losses)
+ Graph of rank over time
+ Minimal stat tracking

Data stored at `%APPDATA%\OverwatchRankTracker`.
